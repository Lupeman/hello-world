# hello-world
My first repository
Hi everyone, 
I'm learning to code online by myself. Not an easy task but one that I enjoy. I especially love the satisfaction that comes from taking on a challenging bit of code/learning and nailing it!
I'm new to github and look forward to working with others and using it to enrich my learning experience.
